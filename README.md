README: Full Stack Web Application

Architecture

This project involved developing a full stack web application with both customer-facing and administrative components. The frontend was built using Express HTML, JavaScript, and a single-page application (SPA) framework. The Express HTML setup handled static pages, JavaScript enhanced interactivity, and the SPA improved user experience by dynamically updating content without full page reloads.

The backend utilized a NoSQL MongoDB database due to its flexibility with handling unstructured data, scalability, and seamless JSON storage, which aligns well with a JavaScript-based stack (Node.js, Express, and MongoDB). Unlike relational databases, MongoDB allows for dynamic schema changes, making it ideal for evolving web applications.

Functionality

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is different from JavaScript in that it is a lightweight data format used to store and exchange data. JSON bridges the frontend and backend by structuring data in a way that both can understand, enabling smooth API communication.

Throughout development, code refactoring improved efficiency and maintainability. For example, we consolidated repeated UI elements into reusable components, such as forms and authentication modals, making updates easier and ensuring consistency across the application.

Testing

API endpoints were tested using methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to validate request and response handling. With added security layers for the admin login, authentication testing ensured that only authorized users could access restricted areas. Methods such as token-based authentication and hashed passwords were implemented to enhance security. Testing also involved validating API responses, handling errors gracefully, and ensuring performance under different conditions.

Reflection

This course strengthened my full stack development skills, including frontend frameworks, backend integration, database management, API security, and testing strategies. The experience enhanced my ability to build, secure, and optimize web applications, making me a more competitive candidate in the job market. Understanding NoSQL databases, authentication protocols, and API communication has been especially valuable, aligning with industry best practices for modern web development.
